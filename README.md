The original source code is accessible here [Extensions-Hello-World](https://github.com/twitchdev/extensions-hello-world).

_Disclaimer_

> This example cover several topics regarding Clean Code, Clean Architecture, Crafted Design and Test-Driven Development. There are also [different points that are left deliberately open](issue page), which you can use to reflect and practice more. The code here is intented for an audience who wants to learn more about Clean Code and/or is looking for a new didactical content.

## Setup

```
mix deps.get
```

## Tests

```
mix test
```

## Start the application

Remember to set the `twitch extension secret` via the `JWT_TOKEN_AUTHENTICATOR_SECRET` env var

```
export JWT_TOKEN_AUTHENTICATOR_SECRET=<TWITCH EXTENSION SECRET>
```

Start

```
mix run --no-halt
```

The server will listen at port `4001`

Make some calls:

```
curl -v -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>" http://localhost:4001/color/cycle
```

The `<JWT_TOKEN>` is generated by the client and contains the information about `channel_id` and `user_id`
